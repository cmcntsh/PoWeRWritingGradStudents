# Prewriting, Writing, & Rewriting:<br>PoWeR Writing for Graduate Students

Writing for graduate school can be broken down into phases or steps. The main steps are <ins>**P**</ins>rewriting, <ins>**W**</ins>riting, and <ins>**R**</ins>ewriting (Sainani, n.d.). This can be abbreviated using the acronym PWR. When sounding this out, it sounds a lot like the word "power". Conveniently enough, the word power contains a couple of additional letters that could represent other tasks we engage in during the writing process. "O" can stand for "organizing" and "E" can stand for "evaluating" (Krause, 2022). Taken all together, "PoWeR" represents a useful step-by-step process to write. In addition, "PoWeR" can also refer to turbocharging your writing process by using the many resources available at each step along the way. Here is a list of resources that may be helpful at each step of the writing process.

# <ins>P</ins>rewriting

Prewriting is the stage where you collect and organize information (Sainani, n.d.).

## Prewriting Workflow

1. Understand the requirements for your paper.
1. Find relevant evidence.
    1. Keep track of potential evidence sources with a citation manager.
1. Summarize how a relevant evidence source addresses an aspect of your paper.
    1. Use citations with your summaries.
1. Arrange your summary evidence into logical groupings in preparation for the writing phase.
2. Add notes of things you may want to say regarding your evidence and about the topic of your paper.
3. Arrange groupings into a logical order that will make sense to the reader.

## Understanding Requirements

### Features of Academic Writing

* Academic writing is structured, evidenced, critical, balanced, precise, objective, and formal. (https://www.eapfoundation.com/writing/what/)
  * Note that the video on the site linked above gives advice about how to write objectively, which is considered outdated. First, the speaker advises writers to use passive construction. Current practice is to use active construction as much as possible. (I like advice from George Gopen regarding when to use passive construction. https://www.georgegopen.com/uploads/1/0/9/0/109073507/litigation_10_why_the_passive_should_be_used.pdf) Second, the speaker advises writers not to use first-person pronouns. Current APA recommendations are to use first-person pronouns when describing actions you personally took. (https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/grammar/first-person-pronouns)
* Academic writing: A practical guide https://subjectguides.york.ac.uk/academic-writing
  * This site provides a good overview and links to some useful tutorials and videos.

### Writing in a Genre

* A genre is a set of forms or standards expected by a community (Booth et. al., 2016). The genre we focus on in much of academic writing in nursing is the research report with five sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion (Booth et. al., 2016).
* Much quality improvement reporting follows a more specific standard called Revised Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence or SQUIRE 2.0 guidelines (Ogrinc et. al., 2015). SQUIRE 2.0 follows a slightly shorter version of the five part research report called Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion (IMRAD). http://www.squire-statement.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.ViewPage&PageID=471

### Divide a Paper into Sections

* If it has not been done already, you may find it beneficial to divide your paper into specific sections and understand the content that should be included in each section.
* Create an outline based on the required sections.

### Organize Your Thoughts

* Plannin General Structure https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhuOJ5Rhy18

### Evaluating Evidence

* If you need to evaluate the strength of evidence, use a recognized framework.
* The Johns Hopkins model is suitable for evaluating a wide range of evidence (Dang et al., 2021).
* Quoting, paraphrasing, and Synthesizing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhtxm5CSwUs
* Building a critical argument https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gdMJ19QqRc

## Prewriting Tools

Several tools can help with parts of the prewriting process.

### Finding Evidence

* Search scholarly databases.
  * Here is a link to the Eccles Library website https://library.med.utah.edu/
* I maintain a list of AI literature search tools.
  * Searching for Literature https://github.com/cmcntsh/LitSearchAIResources

### Working with References

If you are citing more than a handful of sources in your writing, I recommend using a citation manager. You have to take the time to ensure your references are formatted correctly in any papers you write. Using a citation manager allows you to import literature quickly and check the formatting once instead of checking the formatting every time the reference is used in a paper. 

* Zotero is available for free. It has some nice integration with web browsers and allows you to share references with groups. https://www.zotero.org/
  * How to use Zotero (A complete beginner's guide) (13 min) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JG7Uq_JFDzE
  * How to use Zotero 2023 - Full tutorial with examples (25 min) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnbwKj6-pD8
  * Reading, annotating, note-taking, and drafting/outlining with Zotero 6 (20 min) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZTjiSSOsE4
  * Best add-ons in Zotero | easy to use | better notes | literature review mindmap | research (11 min) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgiG-H4tjSI
* If you're a student at the University of Utah, EndNote is available for a reasonable cost from the [Office of Software Licensing](https://software-catalog.app.utah.edu/product/1076). (I currently prefer working with Zotero. It's free and in many ways I find it easier to use.)
* I recommend purchasing the most current APA manual. As of 2023 that is APA 7 (American Psychological Association, 2020). However, many things can be looked up online on the APA Style Blog https://apastyle.apa.org/
* (new in 2023) APA has come out with guidance on citing ChatGPT https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt . You should mention in the Methods section of your paper how you used AI tools if you used them as part of your workflow.

<br>  

# <ins>W</ins>riting

Writing is the stage where you produce your first draft of organized text. At this stage, it's more important to get a first draft written than it is to have a well-written first draft (Sainani, n.d.). Worry about revising later.

## Writing Workflow

1. Work from your outline and notes created during the prewriting phase.
2. Write a draft of your paper or paper section using full sentences.
3. Don't overthink this step. It's most important to get your thoughts down on paper than it is to have everything done well. You will work on how well things are done in the rewriting phase.

## Writing Tools

* I always recommend the use of Grammarly. Graduate students at the U of U have free access. https://gradschool.utah.edu/resources-hub/grammarly/index.php
* The [Graduate Student Writing Center](https://writingcenter.utah.edu/) is a good resource for writing help.

# <ins>R</ins>ewriting

Rewriting or revision is the stage where most evaluation takes place. Rewriting is an iterative process, and multiple checks and revisions may be needed to ensure adequate coverage of the intended material, correct spelling and grammar are used, and other stylistic choices lead to the clearest writing possible and the best experience for the reader. In professional publishing, editing is often broken down into three main phases: substantive editing - focused on structure and organization; copyediting - focused on correcting sentence problems; and proofreading - focused on final appearance (Grammarly, 2023).

## Rewriting Workflow

1. Correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation before sending your work to other people. (See AI Prompts to Help with Rewriting below.)
2. Evaluate the comprehensiveness of content coverage. (See AI Prompts to Help with Rewriting below.)
2. Edit for structure and organization. (See AI Prompts to Help with Rewriting below.)
3. Edit for clarity and conciseness. (See AI Prompts to Help with Rewriting below.)
4. Edit for consistent tone. (See AI Prompts to Help with Rewriting below.)
5. Final edit for spelling, grammar, and punctuation. (See AI Prompts to Help with Rewriting below.)
6. Reader Expectation Approach considerations (See Reader Expectation Approach to Writing link below.)
    1. How do the paragraphs in a section relate to each other?
    2. Is the paragraph issue in the first one to three sentences of the paragraph?
    3. Does the paragraph have a point? Is it articulated in the correct place?
    4. Is the main action of each sentence conveyed by the verb?
    5. Do any sentences have long subject-verb separations making them hard to read?
    6. Does the topic position of each sentence have the correct entity for the intended story?
    7. Does each sentence have the old information needed to link backward in the Topic position?
    8. Is stressworthy information in each sentence in a stress position?

## Manual Writing Analysis Techniques

Automated writing tools have come a long way, but they're still not a complete replacement for your most powerful writing tool - your own ability to craft what you intend to say. Train your brain to recognize and produce good writing. The rest of the tools listed in this guide will be of limited use if you don't have good analytical skills.

### Reader Expectation Approach to Writing

I attended a presentation by an emeritus professor of rhetoric named George Gopen in 2023, where I was introduced to the Reader Expectation Approach to writing. The gist of his method is that the writer needs to consider how readers of English prose usually interpret the meaning of sentences and write so readers are more likely to interpret the intended meaning of a work. Dr. Gopen has published a number of works, but I **HIGHLY** recommend his series of articles on litigation. They're free to access and easy to digest (Available at https://www.georgegopen.com/litigation-articles.html) Most of the articles are 1-2 pages long. He describes how to structure writing to facilitate reader interpretation of the intended meaning. He answers such questions as: When should passive voice be used? When is a sentence too long or too short? How to reinforce key points? And how do you write for clarity and ease of reading? (You may wonder what articles on litigation have to do with scientific or academic writing. The answer is scientific and academic writing is usually about making an argument and supporting it with evidence. If you read the articles, you will see they are very relevant.) I might mention that he has consulted on writing grant proposals that have been awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in research funding.

### Analyze the Rhetorical Purpose of a Piece of Writing

I did exercises like this during my PhD program. They were very useful for helping me understand writing better.

### Paragraphs

* A lot of final refinement work will consist of evaluating and refining the content and order of your paragraphs.
  * Here are some nice articles on what you should understand about the purpose of paragraphs and how to structure paragraphs.
    * [The Ultimate Guide to Paragraphs](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/paragraphs/) (Ellis, 2021a)
    * [How to Write Strong Paragraphs](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/paragraph-structure/) (Ellis, 2022)
    * [On Paragraphs](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/paragraphs_and_paragraphing/index.html) (Purdue Online Writing Lab, 2022a)
    * "You may have learned that every paragraph should begin with a topic sentence and be directly relevant to the section in which it appears. Those are good rules of thumb, but applied too strictly they can make your writing seem stiff. The important thing is to structure and arrange your paragraphs so that they lead your readers through the conversation you are orchestrating. Open each paragraph with a sentence or two that signal its key concepts. Doing that will help readers better understand what follows. If your opening doesn't also state the paragraph's point, then your last sentence should. Never bury the point in the middle." (Booth et al, 2016, p. 195)
    * "There is no minimum or maximum sentence length in APA Style. Overuse of short, simple sentences produces choppy prose, however, and overuse of long, involved sentences results in difficult, sometimes incomprehensible, language. Varied sentence length helps readers maintain interest and comprehension. When involved concepts require long sentences, the components should proceed logically. Avoid including multiple ideas in a single sentence; instead, break the sentence into shorter ones. Direct, declarative sentences with simple, common words are usually best.
Similar cautions apply to paragraph length. Single-sentence paragraphs are abrupt and should be used infrequently. Paragraphs that are too long (i.e., longer than one double-spaced manuscript page) risk losing readers' attention. A new paragraph signals a shift to a new idea and provides a pause for readers - a chance to assimilate one step in the conceptual development before beginning another. Look for a logical place (or places) to break up a long paragraph or reorganize the material." (American Psychological Association, 2020, p. 115)

### AI Prompts to Help with Rewriting

I currently recommend these tools for general-purpose text prompts: (See tools at https://github.com/cmcntsh/PoWeRWritingGradStudents/blob/main/README.md#ai-prompts-to-help-organize-text) I would use the following prompts on individual sections of your paper and not the entire paper all at once. I would use each prompt individually, evaluate the suggested changes, and update your text as desired before moving to the next prompt. I would then use your revised text as the starting point for the next editing prompt.

#### Preliminary check of grammar and spelling before sending your work to others

Prompt: Review each sentence for spelling, grammar, and punctuation problems (This prompt worked slightly better if I did it in two steps. Step 1 - Ask for each sentence to be split into a separate line and numbered and submit the text. Step 2 - Ask for a review of each sentence for grammar, syntax, usage, spelling and punctuation errors and specific suggestions for improvements.)

```
Please list each sentence of this text in a new line, and please number the lines. In addition, please review each sentence for grammar, syntax, usage, spelling, and punctuation errors and suggest specific improvements. When suggesting revisions, please list the sentence number, the original sentence, the reason a revision might be needed, and then the revised sentence. If no revision is suggested, please indicate that no revision is needed.  Here is the text: "[paste text here inside quotes]"
```

#### Evaluate the Comprehensiveness of Content Coverage

You can evaluate a paper or paper section for how well relevant elements are addressed.

Prompt:

```
How well does the following text answer each of these questions? Question 1? Question 2? Question 3? Etc? 
Here is the text: "[Paste the text you want evaluated here.]"
```

#### Analyze How Paragraphs in a Section Connect With Each Other

I recommend doing this with each paper section separately.

Prompt:

```
You are an expert editor of academic writing and scholarly articles. We are going to analyze this text according to the reader expectation approach to writing described by George Gopen. We are going to focus on the logic and flow between the paragraphs of a piece of writing. Gopen states that a backward link to the previous paragraph is easiest for the reader to make if it connects to the same two locations: (1) the beginning of the previous paragraph, where its issue is stated; or (2) the end of the previous paragraph - the nearest neighbor to this new paragraph. Backward connections to the middle of the previous paragraph are harder for the reader to perceive. For each paragraph, write out the paragraph. Then answer these questions about each paragraph. Does the paragraph have a single main issue? What is it? Does the paragraph have good logic and flow internally? Does the paragraph connect well with the previous paragraph? If there is a connection between the paragraph and the previous paragraph, does the paragraph connect with the beginning, middle, or end of the previous paragraph? Are the paragraphs arranged in a logical sequence? Do the paragraphs have good flow from one to the next?
Here is the text: "<paste text here>"
```

#### Analyze a Paragraph and Each Sentence in the Paragraph Using Concepts from  George Gopen's Reader Expectation Approach to Writing

```
You are an expert editor of academic writing and scholarly articles. We are going to analyze this text according to the reader expectation approach to writing described by George Gopen. Gopen states that a paragraph should describe the issue of the paragraph in the first one to three sentences of the paragraph. Gopen also states that if the paragraph explicitly states a point, it should be stated as the last sentence of the issue or the last sentence of the discussion of the paragraph. For each paragraph, write out the paragraph. Then answer these questions about each paragraph.
What is the issue of the paragraph? What is the paragraph about? Does the paragraph have a one-sentence, two-sentence, or three-sentence issue? What are the discussion points in the paragraph? Is the ordering of discussion points logical? What is the point of the paragraph? Why was the paragraph written? Is the point of the paragraph explicitly stated, or is it implied? Is the paragraph a narrative paragraph that simply relays information so a point can be made later, or is the point of the paragraph explicitly stated in the paragraph? Does the point appear at the beginning of the paragraph or at the end? If the paragraph explicitly states a point, does the point appear at the last sentence of the issue or at the last sentence of the discussion, or somewhere else in the paragraph? Does the paragraph have a coda as the last sentence of the paragraph? Can you suggest any improvements to how the paragraph is structured? Is the ordering of the paragraphs logical? Can you suggest any improvements to how the paragraphs should be ordered?
Next, analyze each sentence according to the concepts for sentence construction in the reader expectation approach described by Gopen. List each sentence and answer the following questions for the sentence.
Which words in the sentence appear in the stress position just before a period, a colon, or a semicolon? What nominalizations are used in the sentence? What are the main actions expressed as verbs in the sentence? What is the main clause of the sentence? Does the main clause end with a period, colon, or semicolon? What is the grammatical subject of the main clause? Is there a qualifying clause or phrase in the sentence? What is the subject of the qualifying clause or phrase? Does the sentence have two main clauses separated by a comma? Is the subject and the verb separated by more than four words in the sentence? Does the sentence connect backward to the sentence that precedes it? If so, what is the connection? How close to the beginning of the sentence does the link to the previous sentence appear? Can you suggest any improvements to how the sentence is structured? Can you suggest any improvements to how the sentence links to the preceding sentence to improve flow?
Here is the text: "<Paste paragraph text here between quotes.>"
```

#### Evaluate Which Sentences Need Supporting Citations and References

```
Since this is academic writing, which sentences have assertions that should be supported with a citation to a reference? Please list each sentence that needs a citation and why it needs one.
```
