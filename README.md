# PoWeR Writing for Graduate Students Resource Page

Writing for graduate school can be broken down into phases or steps. The main steps are <ins>**P**</ins>rewriting, <ins>**W**</ins>riting, and <ins>**R**</ins>evising (Sainani, n.d.). This can be abbreviated using the acronym PWR. When sounding this out, it sounds a lot like the word "power". Conveniently enough, the word power contains a couple of additional letters that could represent other tasks we engage in during the writing process. "O" can stand for "organizing" and "E" can stand for "evaluating" (Krause, 2022). Taken all together, "PoWeR" represents a useful way to write. Here is a list of resources that may be helpful at each step of the writing process.

# <ins>P</ins>rewriting

Prewriting is the stage where you collect and organize information (Sainani, n.d.).

## Tools

## Understanding Requirements

### Writing to a Genre

* A genre is a set of forms or standards expected by a community (Booth et. al., 2016). The genre we focus on in much of academic writing in nursing is the research report with five sections: Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion (Booth et. al., 2016).
* Much quality improvement reporting follows a more specific standard called Revised Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence or SQUIRE 2.0 guidelines (Ogrinc et. al., 2015). SQUIRE 2.0 follows a slightly shorter version of the five part research report called Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion (IMRAD). http://www.squire-statement.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.ViewPage&PageID=471

# <ins>W</ins>writing

Writing is the stage where you produce your first draft of organized text.
